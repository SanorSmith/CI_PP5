## Introduction

The **Cherry Leaf Disease Detector** is a machine learning solution developed to assist the agricultural industry, specifically Farmy & Foods, in early detection of powdery mildew on cherry leaves. The project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for accurate image classification, helping farmers identify infections early to protect crop yield and quality. This project is part of the Code Institute's Full Stack Software Development Bootcamp.

The application is integrated into an intuitive Streamlit dashboard where users can upload images of cherry leaves to receive real-time predictions. The solution is scalable, making it adaptable for detecting other plant diseases in the future.
